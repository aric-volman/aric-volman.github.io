# In the beginning...

It all began because I was interested in a little event called Robot Tour. The challenge is to create a robot that can navigate a pre-programmed path, reaching 3 checkpoints in at least 55 seconds. Although this may sound trivial, it is not. There are several things that stop us from obtaining a perfect score. The classical robot has two motors and no encoders/odometry, and its problems follow:

- The robot must control its speed precisely, or else it will be inaccurate in every move
- The robot has no idea where it is if it can't record its position
- The robot loses accuracy when turning 90 degrees, because it makes a wide swing

I settled on a three-wheel design, which is a challenge. Here are some of the benefits:

- It is omni-directional, meaning it can move in any direction
- Turns are not an issue anymore, because it can change direction without changing heading
- Less power draw than mecanum (500 mA draw per motor, 3x motor = 1.5 A, less than 2 A limit for AA batteries)

# CAD-A-Thon

I began by designing a two motor design with two motors. Then, I thought of all of the above points and the benefits of a three-motor frame. Thus, I came up with this:

Some aspects of the design:

- Uses a pegboard design, which makes the robot more modular (can add sensors and dowel later on)
- Motor mounts are screwed on to pegboard with #8-32 or possible M4
- Motor covers are attached via M3 screws with heat inserts
- Shaft collars use available M4/Meccano screwS (from building kit)
- Most things are 3D printable

It is estimated to cost around 12 hours of printing time in total for the entire robot. This is a trade-off between time and money (a custom fabrication would cost a lot).
Other essentials (such as RP 2040 and breadboard + battery) will be velcroed on.

# Wheel Challenges

The design and fabrication of the wheel is the most challenging part of this entire project. We need a 40 mm diameter omni wheel that is cheap and easy enough to fabricate. However, entirely 3D printing it will not cut it.

## A World of Layers

The primary design is a three-layered heel.
