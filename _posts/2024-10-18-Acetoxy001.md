# In the beginning...

It all began because I was interested in a little event called Robot Tour. The challenge is to create a robot that can navigate a pre-programmed path, reaching 3 checkpoints in at least 55 seconds. Although this may sound trivial, it is not. There are several things that stop us from obtaining a perfect score. The classical robot has two motors and no encoders/odometry, and its problems follow:

- The robot must control its speed precisely, or else it will be inaccurate in every move
- The robot has no idea where it is if it can't record its position
- The robot loses accuracy when turning 90 degrees, because it makes a wide swing

I settled on a three-wheel design, which is a challenge. Here are some of the benefits:

- It is omni-directional, meaning it can move in any direction
- Turns are not an issue anymore, because it can change direction without changing heading
- Less power draw than mecanum (500 mA draw per motor, 3x motor = 1.5 A, less than 2 A limit for AA batteries)
